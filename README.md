# Mongoose OS driver for PCA9685

This is a driver for [PCA9685](docs/PCA9685.pdf).

## Device details


The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for
Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications. Each LED output has its
own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates
at a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is
adjustable from 0 % to 100 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.
All outputs are set to the same PWM frequency.
